# Security-Operation-Centre-SOC-Lab

## Objective

The Security Operations Centre Lab aimed to generate logs from nodes on an enterprise network. The primary focus was to monitor network events happening on nodes on a network using a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system, generating test telemetry to mimic real-world network monitoring. This hands-on experience was designed to gain a full understanding of logs are generated and sent to a SIEM system and how we use the SIEM to monitor events happening on network nodes.

### Skills Learned

- Advanced understanding of SIEM (SPLUNK) concepts and practical application.
